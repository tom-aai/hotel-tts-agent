/**
 * The routing server for the voice-preference study (Phase 4 of
 * `docs/tts-preference-build-plan.md`).
 *
 * The study runs twelve copies of the one hotel agent — the same tools, the same
 * prompt, the same booking flow — that differ in NOTHING but the voice. This
 * server builds the hotel agent once, stands up one engine per voice row, and
 * hands each incoming call to the next engine in an even rotation, so over many
 * callers the twelve voices stay balanced. It remembers which voice each call
 * got (keyed by the session id, which is the call id the survey will carry) and
 * serves the page the project already builds.
 *
 * ## Why this is a file rather than `aai start`
 *
 * `aai start` serves ONE agent — one voice. The study needs one front door that
 * fans out to twelve. There is no single-agent knob for that, so this owns the
 * boot: it loads the SAME built worker `aai start` would (`loadBuiltAgent`, the
 * `.aai/worker.mjs` artifact with its tools and prompt lowered in), then wraps
 * twelve runtimes built from it behind one {@link SessionRuntime} facade and
 * serves that with `createRuntimeServer`. Everything below the routing — the
 * session, the pipeline, the client config, the static client — is the
 * framework's, unchanged.
 *
 * Run it after a build: `npm start` builds the worker (its `prestart`) and then
 * runs this. `PORT` and `HOST` are read the way `aai start` reads them, so the
 * Render setup in Phase 9 needs nothing new.
 *
 * ## ElevenLabs is wired in (Phase 8)
 *
 * Phases 3 and 4 were built in parallel: Phase 3 built the ElevenLabs connector
 * (`elevenlabs-tts-host.ts`), Phase 4 built this server. Phase 8 joins them —
 * `main()` calls `registerElevenLabsTts()` before building any engine, so the
 * four `elevenlabs` rows resolve and speak like any other row and all twelve
 * engines stand up. The resolution is eager (per the runtime, a voice agent
 * resolves its TTS opener at `createRuntime` time, not at first call), which is
 * exactly why the registration has to happen first. `buildEngines` still catches
 * a row that fails to resolve and skips it with a note, so a bad key or a missing
 * registration degrades to the engines that did build rather than taking the
 * whole server down.
