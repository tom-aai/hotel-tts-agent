/**
 * The Harborlight front desk, on the phone — but for the voice-preference study,
 * not as the open-ended receptionist the template ships. This agent walks every
 * caller through ONE fixed booking script (`desk.ts`), so that twelve copies of
 * it, each with a different voice, are all judged on the same words. The study
 * and the reason for the fixed script are in `docs/tts-preference-plan.md`.
 *
 * The call never books anything and never takes a card: the script's closing
 * twist ("you're a regular, it's on us") is exactly what lets it exercise the
 * voice on a name, a night and an address — the hard material for a TTS — and
 * then end without any payment. There are no tools at all: the whole call is the
 * dialog's speak-only turns, so the simplified agent only ever runs the script.
